# Team Norms

## Team Values
- We will work together in weekly meetings where we discuss what needs to be done, what has been completed, and the things each person will be working going forwards.

- If anyone needs help, they can message the discord at any time or discuss their problems in our weekly meetings if they are not urgent.

### Resolving Conflicts

- Disagreements: If any disagreements come up regarding any part of the process that cannot be easily resolved, we will create a vote on the direction that we want the project to move in.

- Failing to meet obligations: If any individual is failing to meet their obligations, we will first assess why they are not able to complete their work and/or adjust our roles accordingly. If this problem becomes reocurring despite attempts to accomodate their personal issues, we will need to contact course administrators.   

- Time to respond to messages: If any message is directed at you, you are expected to respond to the message or at least acknowledge you have seen it within the day that it is sent.

## Sprint Cadence

Each Sprint should take approximately two to three weeks, depending on the course schedule. 

## Daily Standups

We will have a daily standup on 3/06, 3/08, 3/27, 3/29, 4/03, 4/12, 4/17, 4/19, 4/26, 5/01. The exact times will be organized through the discord in the days leading up to the standup. 

The standups will take place either syncronously through a Discord voice call or in-person on campus.

We agree to attend every standup and other members will not cover for members who do not attend.

Members who do not attend or make any notable progress on a task for two standups or more without communication with the rest of the members may be reported to course administration.
